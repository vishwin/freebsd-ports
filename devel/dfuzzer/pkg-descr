dfuzzer is a tool for fuzz testing processes communicating through D-Bus.
It can be used to test processes connected to both the session bus and the
system bus. The fuzzer works as a client, first connecting to a bus and then
traversing and fuzzing all the methods and properties provided by a D-Bus
service.
