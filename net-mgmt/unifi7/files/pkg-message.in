ATTENTION: The mongodb dependency has been changed from 36 to 44, as MongoDB
3.6 is long out out support and end of life.

One of implications is that the instance MUST be restored from backup.

The upgrade path can be as following:

- Take a backup from within the unifi7 application BEFORE stopping or
  restarting the service.

- Stop the unifi7 service.

- Copy the "backup" directory from %%LOCALBASE%%/share/java/unifi/data/db
  to a safe location.

- Remove all files and directories under
  %%LOCALBASE%%/share/java/unifi/data/db

- Upgrade the package

- Copy the "backup" directory from the safe place to
  %%LOCALBASE%%/share/java/unifi/data/db

- Start the service.

- Restore the configuration from backup.
