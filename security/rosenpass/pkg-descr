Rosenpass provides a complement to the well-known WireGuard standard, adding
quantum-hardened cryptography and key exchange while keeping the established
WireGuard standard encryption security. So Rosenpass is an add-on, enhancing
WireGuard+IBk-s key negotiation process with Post Quantum Secure (PQS)
cryptography, based on the McEliece cryptosystem.
