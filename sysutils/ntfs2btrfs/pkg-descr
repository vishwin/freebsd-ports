Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft's NTFS
file system to the open-source file system Btrfs, much as btrfs-convert
does for ext2.  The original image is saved as a reflink copy at
``image/ntfs.img'', and if you want to keep the conversion you can delete
this to free up space.
