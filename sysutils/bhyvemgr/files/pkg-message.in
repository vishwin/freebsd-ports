4) Now, bhyvemgr supports the use of cloud and VM images. You can even use cloud
   init or nuageinit to initialize them.

5) If you use a minimal configuration it uses  files templates files inside
   of %%DATADIR%%/templates directory.

6) If you want to use your own configuration files: user-data, meta-data, try to
   keep %%UUID%% and %%HOSTAME%% inside of them as you can look at
   %%DATADIR%%/samples directory.

   They will be will replace with virtual machine values.
