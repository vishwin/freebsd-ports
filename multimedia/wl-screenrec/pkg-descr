High performance screen recorder for Wayland. Requres a wayland
compositor supporting wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 and
wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1 protocols, like sway and Hyprland.

Uses dma-buf transfers to get surface, and uses the GPU to do both the
pixel format conversion and the encoding, meaning the raw video data
never touches the CPU, leaving it free to run your applications.

Requires libva-intel-media-driver or libva-intel-driver on Intel GPUs,
mesa-gallium-va on AMD GPUs or libva-vdpau-driver on NVIDIA GPUs.
