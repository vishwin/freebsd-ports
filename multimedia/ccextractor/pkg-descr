CCExtractor is the de-facto open source standard for closed captions /
subtitles extraction from any media file.  While the software itself
belong to the niche category (main users being universities, media
companies and enthusiasts) its output (meaning the .srt files it
generates) is used by millions.  If you've ever downloaded an external
subtitle file for a TV show - most likely the original file came from
CCExtractor.
